## Rules
Twenty is a two player gambling game. The goal is to get as close to 20 as possible, without going in.

Both players begin by paying the blind (generally one token each).

Coin is flipped (or dice are rolled) to determine which player will go first.

That player can then either purchase a die, or hold.

If they purchase a die, the player places that much into the pot and then rolls the die, adding it to their 'total'.

If the player holds they can not purchase any more die for this round.

Once all dice have been purchased and rolled, the winner takes the pot. 

If the players have the same total, then the pot is split.

If players decide to play another round, the other player begins the round.
